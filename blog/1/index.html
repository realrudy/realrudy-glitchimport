          You may know how annoying it is when Blocksi blocks a page you want to
          visit. Blocksi was invented just for that sole purpose, student
          filtering software. So what if we could reverse it. Blocking websites
          from teachers? That is impossible. No not really since Teachers Don't
          have the student version of blocksi that means that you can code a
          script to redirect users who don't have the blocksi "block" page show
          up. So if the blocksi page shows up for me and it blocks a site then I
          could code it so then it would let me access the site but not let
          teachers in. Well, Derin and I did it. We coded a script that would do
          exactly what I just said.

  var frame = document.createElement("iframe");
  frame.style.display = "none";
  frame.src = "/ghlpmldmjjhmdgmneoaibbegkjjbonbk";
  document.documentElement.appendChild(frame);
  frame.onload = function () {
    setTimeout(function () {
      if (frame.contentWindow.document) {
        // Frame wasn't redirected, likely no Blocksi
        localStorage.noBlocksi = true;
        noBlocksi();
        }

          If you put that code in a script.js file or a script tag then it will
          work. After you put the code in it should let you stay on the site
          (Make sure you are using your school Chromebook). If you use a PC you
          have at home and try to visit the website you made, it will redirect
          you to google. If you have a basic understanding of Javascript then
          you can change the redirect to something else or make it more complex.
